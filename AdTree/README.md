AdTree implements the tree reconstruction method described in the following [paper](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/liangliang/publications/2019/adtree/AdTree_RS-2019.pdf):

### Build and Run AdTree
Prebuilt executables (for **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**) can be downloaded 
[here](https://github.com/tudelft3d/adtree/releases). 

AdTree depends on some third-party libraries and most dependencies are included in the distribution except 
[Boost](https://www.boost.org/). So you will need to have Boost install first. 

Note: AdTree uses a stripped earlier version of [Easy3D](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D), which is not 
compatible with the latest version.

You need [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and of course a compiler to build AdTree:

- CMake `>= 3.1`
- a compiler that supports `>= C++17`

AdTree has been tested on macOS (Xcode >= 8), Windows (MSVC >=2015), and Linux (GCC >= 4.8, Clang >= 3.3). Machines 
nowadays typically provide higher [supports](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support), so you should be 
able to build AdTree on almost all platforms.

There are many options to build AdTree. Choose one of the following (or whatever you are familiar with):

- Option 1: Use any IDE that can directly handle CMakeLists files to open the `CMakeLists.txt` in the root directory 
of AdTree. Then you should have obtained a usable project and just build. I recommend using
 [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) or [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/product).
- Option 2: Use CMake to generate project files for your IDE. Then load the project to your IDE and build.
- Option 3: Use CMake to generate Makefiles and then build.
  - on Linux or macOS:
    ```
    $ cd adtree
    $ mkdir Release
    $ cd Release
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    $ make
    ```
  - on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio:
    ```
    $ cd adtree
    $ mkdir Release
    $ cd Release
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    $ msbuild adtree.sln /p:Configuration=Release
    ```

Don't have any experience with C/C++ programming? Have a look at [How to build AdTree step by step](./How_to_build.md).

After obtaining the executable, AdTree can be run in three modes, which can be selected based 
on arguments.
  - GUI mode that provides a user interface with menus. You can double click to run the app or from the command 
    using `./AdTree`.

  - Single processing mode (i.e., processing a single point cloud file) from the command line using
    ```
    ./AdTree <xyz_file_path> <output_directory>
    ```
 - Batch processing mode (i.e., all *.xyz files in the input directory will be treated as input and the reconstructed 
   models will be save in the output directory) from the command line using 
    ```
    ./AdTree <xyz_files_directory> <output_directory>
    ```

### Data
Some test tree point clouds are provided in the '[data](./data)' folder.

**Note:** When testing on your point clouds, please make sure that:
 - your point cloud represents a single tree (i.e., the tree is segmented out from the background; no ground, no fence...);
 - the tree has an upright orientation (i.e., with Z-axis pointing up).
